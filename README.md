Search lands far and wide, dungeons dark and deep, ruins desolate and decrepit for the most scared of grailsâ€¦ the MacGuffin!

## Description
The Ruler of the lands has issued a proclamation of new quest to all interested adventures. The proclamation reads:

> To all of the brave of heart, stout of character, or keen of mind adventurers in the land. I Ruler WhatsTheirName is in need of a most sacred relic; the MacGuffin. I know not where the MacGuffin rests; which is where you come in. To the adventurer that brings me the MacGuffin I promise everlasting fame and a wondrous reward. Go forth and bring to me the MacGuffin.

Upon hearing this proclamation many adventures set out in search of the MacGuffin. You are one such adventurer, are you capable of finding the famed MacGuffin?
